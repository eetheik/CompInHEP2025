In this project we simulate and analyze a hypothetical variant of the Z 
boson which has weaker couplings, making it more difficul to distinguish from 
background processes. The code is structured into two `.cc` files which simulate
the signal and background processes. Included is also a `.py` file for analyzing 
the root files created during the simulation.

Due to the relatively small size of this project it was chosen not to separate into 
smaller subdirectories.

Dependencies:
- ROOT
- PYTHIA (installed in Makefile)
- Python3 (NumPy)

Run the simulation codes with:

`make run`

And then the analysis code with:

`python3 analyze.py`

We simulate 1,000,000 events for signal and 3,000,000 events for 
background to ensure a statistically meaningful analysis after 
applying strict kinematic cuts and isolation criteria. 
For rare processes and to estimate the shape of the invariant 
mass distribution reliably in both signal and background, 
at least 10⁵ – 10⁶ events are often needed. This also allows 
us to determine the trigger efficiency with reasonable 
precision.
